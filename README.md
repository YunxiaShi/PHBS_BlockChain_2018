## Zerocash and sk-SNARK

* ### Data privacy protection technology of blockchain
In order to improve the anonymity of blockchain technology, protect usersâ€™ identity privacy and transaction data privacy, a variety of privacy protection schemes have been proposed, including mixed currency mechanism and encryption protocol technology. Coinjoin, CoinSuffle, Mixcoin, Blindcoin are digital currency that use mixed currency mechanism. The existing technology mainly relies on the third-party platform to mix the transaction sets of multiple users and output them to the corresponding addresses, so that the attacker cannot link the input and output addresses of the transaction. The other is to construct a decentralized anonymous "digital currency" system through cryptography techniques such as multi-party secure computing, blind signature, ring signature and zero-knowledge proof, such as Monero, ZeroCoin and ZeroCash. The following is a comprehensive analysis of ZeroCash and zk-SNARK technology.
